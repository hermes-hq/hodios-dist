# Plan instrument practice

## Inputs

- `instrument` (required): The instrument, e.g. "acoustic guitar", "piano", "violin", "drum kit", "voice", "alto saxophone".
- `level` (required): Your current level in your own words, e.g. "complete beginner", "can play open chords but not barre chords", "grade 5 piano", "gigging bassist who can't read".
- `goal` (optional): What you want to be able to do and by when, e.g. "play 'Blackbird' fingerstyle in 3 months", "pass grade 6 in June", "jam a 12-bar blues with friends". Leave blank for balanced all-round progress.
- `minutes_per_day` (optional; default: 30): Minutes you can realistically practise on a typical day.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
Most players practise by playing through what they already know, which feels productive and changes little. Progress comes from deliberate practice: short, focused work on a specific weakness at a speed where it can be played correctly, with feedback (a metronome, a recording, a teacher) and gradual increases in difficulty. A good plan splits the available time across warm-up, technique, repertoire, ear and rhythm work, rotates the focus across the week so nothing is neglected, sets measurable targets (tempo, accuracy, memorised bars), and protects the body from strain.

<task>
Build a practice plan for $instrument at this level: $level.

Goal: $goal
Time per day: $minutes_per_day minutes

1. **Assumptions:** in three or four lines, what you take the level to mean in concrete skills, the goal (if none was given, choose balanced progress for this level and say so), and whether the goal is realistic in the time stated. If the goal is unrealistic, say so kindly and propose an intermediate milestone. If the level is too vague to plan (for example "okay"), ask up to three questions about what the player can already do and stop.
2. **Daily session:** a template that fits exactly $minutes_per_day minutes, as a table with minutes per block. Typical split: warm-up about 10 to 15 percent; technique about 25 to 30 percent; repertoire or goal piece about 30 to 40 percent; ear training and theory about 10 percent; timing and rhythm, often folded into the other blocks, with a metronome. For each block, name the specific exercises for this instrument and level (scales, arpeggios, chord changes, rudiments, bowing exercises, sight-reading, vocal exercises) and how to do them (for example slow, hands separately, looped four bars).
3. **Weekly rotation:** seven days with a different technical or musical focus per day so all areas are covered, one lighter review or free-play day, and how to adapt when only half the time is available.
4. **Progression:** a target for the end of each of the first four weeks, using measurable targets (metronome tempo at which a passage is clean three times in a row, number of bars memorised, chord changes per minute, a recording to compare against). If the goal has a date further out, add milestones at regular checkpoints up to that date (for example weeks 6, 8 and 12) and say what the final week looks like (run-throughs under performance or exam conditions, no new material). If the goal is less than four weeks away, compress the targets to fit.
5. **Progress checks:** a weekly self-check (record one take, compare with last week, rate accuracy, tone, timing and confidence), and what to change if progress stalls for two weeks.
6. **Practice habits:** three to five habits that matter most for this instrument and goal, such as practising at a tempo you can play cleanly before speeding up, isolating the hardest bars first, interleaving several skills in short blocks, ending with something you enjoy, and resting hands, lips or voice between blocks.
</task>

<constraints>
- Name real, standard exercises and pieces suited to the level; when suggesting specific repertoire, choose widely known pieces or method books you are confident exist, and give alternatives.
- Do not prescribe more time than $minutes_per_day minutes per day.
- Include a short physical-safety note: warm up, keep a relaxed posture, take breaks, and stop and seek advice from a teacher or, for pain, numbness or tingling that persists, a health professional.
- Where a teacher would help a lot (for example the voice, violin bowing or embouchure), say so once without making the plan depend on one.
