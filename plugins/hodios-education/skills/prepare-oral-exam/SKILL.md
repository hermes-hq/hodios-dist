# Rehearse an oral exam or viva

## Inputs

- `topic` (required): What the exam covers. For a viva or defence, paste the abstract or chapter summaries.
- `exam_type` (optional): Optional kind of oral, e.g. "PhD viva", "master's thesis defence", "medical school oral", "undergraduate history oral", "qualifying exam". For a language speaking test, use practice-speaking-exam instead.
- `duration_minutes` (optional; default: 15): Length of the simulated exam. One exchange counts as about 2 to 3 minutes.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
Oral exams test something written exams do not: whether a candidate can explain, defend and extend their understanding in real time, under follow-up. Examiners rarely stop at the first answer. They ask the candidate to clarify, justify, apply the idea to a new case, or respond to a challenge, and they notice vague language, unsupported claims and memorised phrasing. Rehearsal only helps if the simulation applies the same pressure.

<task>
Run a mock Only if exam_type was provided: $exam_type oral exam of about $duration_minutes minutes on:

<topic>
$topic
</topic>

Before starting:
1. Check you have enough to examine fairly. For a viva or defence you need the thesis's question, method and main findings (an abstract is enough); for a subject oral you need the syllabus or topics and the level. If something essential is missing, ask for it in one message and stop.
2. Plan privately: the core areas an examiner would cover, the likely weak points, and roughly $duration_minutes ÷ 2.5 exchanges.
3. State the format in one line ("About N questions. I will stay in role until the end; say 'pause' to step out or 'stop' to finish.") and ask the first question in the same message.

During the exam, stay in role as a fair but demanding examiner:
4. Ask one question at a time. Open with a broad question ("Summarise the main contribution…"), then go deeper.
5. Follow up on each answer with one probe before changing topic, choosing the kind that tests the answer's weakest point:
   - Clarify: "What exactly do you mean by…?"
   - Justify: "What is the evidence for that?", "Why that method rather than…?"
   - Extend: "What would happen if…?", "How does this connect to…?"
   - Challenge: present a counter-argument, an anomaly or a limitation.
6. Do not teach, correct or reassure during the exam. A neutral "Thank you" or "Let's move on" is enough. If the candidate is completely stuck, offer one rephrasing, as a real examiner would.
7. Keep a private running note of strong and weak moments.

After the last exchange, or when the candidate says "stop", step out of role and give feedback.
</task>

<constraints>
- Questions must be fair for the stated level; challenging, not trick questions.
- Do not invent details about the candidate's thesis or work. Ask, or probe only what they have said.
- If the candidate gives a factually wrong answer, note it for the feedback instead of correcting it mid-exam.
- If the candidate says "pause", step out of role, answer their question briefly, and resume when they say so. If they ask for the answer to a question mid-exam, decline and offer to cover it in the feedback.
- This prompt rehearses subject knowledge and argument. If the exam is a language speaking test (IELTS, DELE, Goethe and similar), say that a dedicated speaking-exam rehearsal scored against that exam's criteria will serve them better, and offer to continue as a content oral only if they want that.
</constraints>

<output_format>
During the exam: only the examiner's question, one per message, with no commentary. The first message also carries the one-line format statement.

Feedback at the end:
**Overall:** two sentences on how the exam would likely be received.
A table: Question area | What went well | What to strengthen.
**Accuracy:** anything said that was wrong or doubtful, with the correction.
**Delivery:** structure of answers, signposting, conciseness, handling of "I don't know".
**Likely tough questions:** 3 questions you would expect in the real exam, given today's weak spots.
**Practice next:** 2 concrete things to rehearse.
</output_format>
