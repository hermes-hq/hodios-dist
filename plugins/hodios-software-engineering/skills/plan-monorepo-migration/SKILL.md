# Plan a monorepo migration

## Inputs

- `repos` (required): The repositories to merge, with language, size, build system, how they depend on each other (published packages, git submodules, copy-paste), release process, owning teams and anything that must stay separate.
- `tooling` (optional): Preferred or existing monorepo tooling, if any (for example pnpm workspaces, Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, Pants, Gradle composite builds, Go workspaces).

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
A monorepo pays off when code that changes together lives together: atomic cross-project changes, one dependency version per library, shared tooling. It costs build and CI work: without affected-only builds and caching, every pull request runs everything and the team blames the monorepo. Migrations fail when history is squashed and blame is lost, when CI is ported job by job without change detection, when release processes that assumed one repo per artifact break silently, and when everything moves in one weekend. A good plan checks the decision, moves one repository at a time and keeps the old repositories read-only until the new path is proven.
</context>

<task>
Plan the migration of these repositories:
<repos>
$repos
</repos>
Only if tooling was provided: 
Tooling preference: $tooling

1. **Decision check.** In a few bullets, say whether the repositories share enough change, dependencies and ownership to justify a monorepo, and name any repository that should stay out (different access needs, open source with an external community, very large binaries, a separate compliance boundary). If the input lacks what you need to judge, say so.
2. **Target layout.** A directory tree (`apps/`, `packages/` or `services/`, `libs/`, `tools/`), naming conventions, and how internal dependencies are referenced (workspace protocol, path dependencies) instead of published versions.
3. **Tooling.** Recommend the build tool from the languages, size and preference, with the reason and what it must provide: a project graph, affected-only builds and tests, local and remote caching, and task pipelines. Show the root configuration skeleton.
4. **History.** Preserve history by importing each repository into its subdirectory (for example with `git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter` and a merge with `--allow-unrelated-histories`), keep or prefix tags, and handle large files and secrets found in history before import. Say how `git log --follow` and blame will work afterwards.
5. **CI and releases.** Path-based or graph-based change detection, required checks per project, cache strategy, and a CI time budget. For releases: per-project versioning and tags, changelog generation, and how each artifact's existing release pipeline is pointed at its subdirectory.
6. **Ownership.** CODEOWNERS per directory, branch protection, and review rules for shared libraries.
7. **Rollout.** Order the repositories (start with the one with the fewest dependents or the most cross-repo changes, say which and why), a pilot, a freeze window per repository, the cutover steps, redirects (archive the old repository with a pointer in its README, move open pull requests and issues), and rollback while the old repository is still intact.
8. Name risks with mitigation, and the metrics that show success (CI time per pull request, cross-project change lead time).
</task>

<constraints>
- Commands that rewrite history only ever run on fresh clones; say so next to them. Never on the original repositories.
- Do not recommend a tool feature you are not sure exists; describe the capability and say "check the tool's documentation".
- Do not invent repository sizes, team names or dependency versions.
- Keep each rollout step reversible until the old repository is archived.
- Separate what you verified from what you inferred. Mark inferences as such.
- When you do not know, say "I don't know" once and state what would settle it.
</constraints>
