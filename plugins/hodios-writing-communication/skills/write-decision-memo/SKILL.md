# Write a decision memo

## Inputs

- `situation` (required): What needs deciding and why now, with the facts you have (costs, dates, numbers, constraints, who is affected, what happens if nobody decides).
- `options` (optional): The options you are considering and what you lean toward, if you know. Leave empty to have options proposed from the situation.
- `decision_maker` (optional): Who decides and what they care about, for example "COO, cares about cost and customer churn" or "my manager, new to the project". Leave empty and the memo is written for a busy senior reader, with the name left to fill in.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
A decision memo exists to get a clear yes, no or choice from a busy person in a few minutes. It fails when the decision is buried under background, when the options are a straw man next to the favourite, when costs and risks are vague, or when the reader has to write back to ask what exactly they are approving. Good memos put the ask and the deadline in the first lines, compare real options on the same criteria, admit the downside of the recommendation, and say what happens next under each answer.
</context>

<task>
Write a one-page decision memo.

<situation>
$situation
</situation>
Only if options was provided: 
<options>
$options
</options>
Only if decision_maker was provided: Decision-maker: $decision_maker

1. If you cannot tell what decision is needed or the situation gives no facts to weigh (only feelings or a general complaint), ask up to three short questions and stop. Missing options are not a reason to stop: propose them in step 4. A missing decision-maker is not either: address the memo to `[NEEDED: decision-maker]`, write for a busy senior reader who knows the business but not this issue, and say so under Gaps.
2. State the decision as one question with a yes, no or choice answer, and the date it is needed by (with the reason for that date, such as a notice period or a release date in the situation). If no date can be derived, mark `[NEEDED: decide-by date]`.
3. Write the context the decision-maker needs and nothing more: three to six sentences on what is happening, why it matters now, and the cost of not deciding. Fit it to what the decision-maker already knows and cares about.
4. Lay out two to four genuine options. Always include "do nothing" or "delay" if it is realistic. Compare them on the same criteria (cost, benefit, risk, time, reversibility, effect on people or customers), using only figures from the situation and marking unknowns.
5. Recommend one option and give the deciding reason in one or two sentences. Name its main downside and how it will be managed. If the facts do not support a clear recommendation, say what would settle it.
6. Write next steps if approved: who does what by when, and the first checkpoint where the decision could be revisited.
</task>

<constraints>
- One page: about 350 to 500 words for the memo itself.
- Use only the facts supplied. Never invent costs, dates, percentages or names; mark each gap `[NEEDED: …]` and list it.
- Present options fairly. Do not weaken the alternatives to make the recommendation look better; if an option is clearly not viable, say why in one line.
- Plain, neutral language. No hype, no hedging, no "synergies". Numbers in figures, with units.
- If the decision touches legal, HR, safety or regulatory obligations, note who must also sign off.
</constraints>

<output_format>
## Memo
**To / From / Date / Decision needed by** (names and dates from the situation, otherwise `[NEEDED: …]`)
**Decision needed:** one question.
**Recommendation:** one sentence.
**Context:** short paragraph.
**Options:** a table with options as rows and the criteria as columns, then one line per option on its main risk.
**Why this recommendation:** two to four sentences, including its downside.
**Next steps if approved:** numbered, each with owner and date.
## Gaps to fill
Each `[NEEDED: …]` with what it is and where to get it. "None" if none.
## Before you send
Two or three checks specific to this memo (for example "confirm the vendor price is still valid").
