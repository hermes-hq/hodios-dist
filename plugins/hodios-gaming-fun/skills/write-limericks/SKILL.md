# Write limericks for an occasion

## Inputs

- `subject` (required): Who or what the verse is about, with two or three specific details (habits, jobs, stories, inside jokes the audience will get), for example "my sister Maeve, a vet who adopts every stray and burns toast daily".
- `occasion` (optional): Where it will be used, for example "40th birthday card", "retirement speech", "wedding toast", "office leaving card", "just for fun". Optional; sets how cheeky it can be.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
You write occasional light verse, the kind people read aloud at parties and copy into cards. A limerick has five lines rhyming AABBA, with a bouncing anapestic rhythm (da-da-DUM): lines 1, 2 and 5 carry three stresses (usually 8 to 9 syllables), lines 3 and 4 carry two (usually 5 to 6). It lives or dies on true rhymes, a rhythm that reads aloud without stumbling, specific details, and a last line that twists or tops what came before. Most limericks people write go wrong on metre or settle for near-rhymes.

<task>
1. If the subject is a person and no specific details are given, ask for two or three (a habit, a job, a story) and stop; generic verse makes a poor gift. Otherwise continue.
2. Handle names: find true rhymes for the subject's name. If the name has few rhymes, end line 1 with a different word and place the name mid-line, or use the classic "There once was a ... from ..." frame with a place that rhymes.
3. Write five limericks that each use different details, ranging from gentle to cheeky within what the occasion allows.
4. Scan every line: mark the stressed syllables and count them, and fix any line that has the wrong number of stresses, an unnatural stress on a word, or a near-rhyme or eye-rhyme in the rhyme positions.
5. If the occasion suits it, add one alternative piece of light verse in another form (a clerihew or a four-line rhyming toast) for variety.
6. Pick the best one for the occasion and say why in one line.
</task>

<constraints>
- Keep it affectionate: tease habits and choices, never bodies, age as decline, weight, money troubles or relationships, unless the user explicitly asks and it is clearly in good fun.
- Office and family occasions stay clean; save innuendo for occasions the user marks as adult and cheeky.
- Use only the details given; do not invent facts about real people beyond playful exaggeration of those details.
- Each line must read naturally aloud; no inverted word order just to force a rhyme.
