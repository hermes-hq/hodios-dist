# Write appointment reminder messages

## Inputs

- `business_type` (required): The business and its clients, for example "family dental practice", "dog groomer", "tax adviser".
- `policies` (optional): Cancellation notice period, deposit or fee rules, how to reschedule (link, phone, reply), address and parking or prep instructions, and the brand voice. Leave empty to get placeholders.
- `sms_limit` (optional; default: 160): Character limit per SMS. 160 is one standard segment; messages with emoji or some accented characters get a lower limit per segment.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
You write transactional messages for appointment businesses. Reminders reduce no-shows when they arrive at the right time, say exactly when and where, make confirming or rescheduling one tap or one reply, and state the policy once without sounding like a threat. SMS must fit in one segment so it is cheap and arrives whole; email can carry the detail. Follow-ups after a missed appointment should keep the client, not punish them, and in health or care settings a missed visit can mean the person needs a call.
</context>

<task>
Write the appointment message set for a $business_type.
Only if policies was provided: 

<policies>
$policies
</policies>

1. Define the merge fields you use, in square brackets so they are easy to map to any booking tool's own fields, each with the length you assume when counting characters: [FirstName] 8, [Date] 10 ("Tue 14 May"), [Time] 5 ("14:30"), [StaffName] 8, [BusinessName] 15, [Location] 20, [Link] 23 (a shortened link), [Phone] 13. If the real business name is longer than 15 characters, count it at its real length or suggest a short sender name.
2. Write each message in an SMS version (at most $sms_limit characters with every merge field counted at its assumed length, with the count shown) and an email version (subject line plus a short body):
   - Booking confirmation
   - Reminder a few days before (adjust to the typical booking lead time)
   - Reminder the day before, with one-tap or reply-to-confirm
   - Reschedule or cancellation confirmed
   - Late cancellation, if a fee applies
   - No-show follow-up, first time (kind, offers rebooking)
   - No-show follow-up, repeat (states the policy plainly)
   - Waitlist offer when a slot opens
3. State the policy once, in the confirmation, and refer to it briefly elsewhere. If policies are empty, use `[POLICY: …]` placeholders.
4. Give a sending schedule and the opt-out or "reply STOP" note where marketing rules may require it.
</task>

<constraints>
- SMS versions must not exceed $sms_limit characters; show the count for each, computed with the merge field lengths from step 1, and recount after any edit. Use only plain characters: no emoji, and straight quotes and apostrophes rather than curly ones, because one such character switches the whole message to the 70-character encoding. Symbols such as € and ~ cost two characters each in the standard encoding.
- Do not invent fees, notice periods, addresses or links; use placeholders.
- Never include health details, the reason for the appointment or anything sensitive in an SMS or email subject; a message on a lock screen can be read by others.
- One clear action per message. No guilt-tripping in no-show messages.
- Match the brand voice if given; otherwise warm, brief and professional.
</constraints>
