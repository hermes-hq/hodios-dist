# Plan and implement right-to-left support

## Inputs

- `code_area` (required): The screens, components or paths to make RTL-ready, or the whole app.
- `platform` (optional; one of: web, ios, android, flutter; default: web): UI platform.
- `rtl_locales` (optional; default: ar, he): Right-to-left locales to support.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
Right-to-left support is not `transform: scaleX(-1)` on the whole page. The layout flips, but some things must not: media playback controls, clocks, logos, phone numbers, code and most charts. Mixed-direction text such as an English product name inside an Arabic sentence, or a phone number, needs bidi isolation, or punctuation jumps to the wrong end. Most breakage comes from physical properties (`left`, `marginLeft`, `paddingRight`) and directional icons hard-coded throughout the code.
</context>

<task>
Make $code_area ready for the right-to-left locales $rtl_locales on $platform.

1. **Audit** the code for direction-dependent code, with file and line:
   - **web:** physical CSS (`margin-left`, `padding-right`, `left`, `right`, `text-align: left`, `border-left`, `float`, and corner-specific radii), `translateX` and directional animations, `background-position`, absolute positioning, and a missing `dir` or `lang` on `html`.
   - **ios:** left and right constraints instead of leading and trailing, `NSTextAlignment.left`, images not set to flip, `semanticContentAttribute` overrides, and SwiftUI views that ignore the `layoutDirection` environment.
   - **android:** `android:supportsRtl` missing, left and right attributes instead of start and end (Android Lint flags these as `RtlHardcoded`), and vector drawables without `autoMirrored`.
   - **flutter:** `EdgeInsets.only(left:)`, `Alignment.centerLeft` and `Positioned(left:)` instead of the directional variants, missing `Directionality` or localization delegates, and icons without `matchTextDirection`.
2. **Decide mirroring** for every icon and visual, in a table:
   - Mirror back and forward arrows, chevrons, progress direction, list and indent icons, sliders, and "send" or "reply" arrows.
   - Do not mirror media play and fast-forward, clocks and circular refresh, checkmarks, logos, brand marks, keyboard and code text, or icons showing a real-world object held in the right hand.
   - Charts: time axes in RTL locales are a product decision; flag it rather than flipping silently.
3. **Bidi text:** isolate user-generated or mixed-language text (`dir="auto"`, `bdi`, `unicode-bidi: isolate`, or FSI and PDI characters on native platforms). Keep phone numbers, email addresses, URLs, code and inputs for them left-to-right. Format numbers with the locale formatter, which decides whether to use Arabic-Indic digits.
4. **Typography:** do not apply `letter-spacing` to Arabic (it breaks letter joining), avoid uppercase and italic styles that do not exist in these scripts, check the font stack includes the scripts, allow more line height, and make sure ellipsis truncation lands on the correct side.
5. **Gestures and motion:** swipe-to-go-back, carousels, drawers and slide-in transitions follow the reading direction.
6. **Plan** the work in phases: foundation (document direction, locale plumbing, lint rules that block new physical properties), shared components, screens, assets, then QA. Give each phase an S, M or L effort and note its dependencies.
7. **Implement** the foundation and the changes in $code_area. Prefer logical equivalents (`margin-inline-start`, `inset-inline-end`, `text-align: start`, `leading`, `start`, `EdgeInsetsDirectional`) over direction branches. Use an explicit RTL override only where the logical form cannot express the intent.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not flip the whole UI with a mirror transform.
- Left-to-right rendering must not change. Verify that each change renders the same in LTR.
- Translation is out of scope. Use a pseudo-RTL locale or the platform's force-RTL option for testing.
- Do only what was asked. If you notice something else worth changing, mention it in one line at the end instead of changing it.
- Keep the change as small as it can be while still being correct.
- Read the relevant code before making a claim about it. Do not guess what a file, function or config contains.
- If the information you need is not available, say what is missing and how to get it instead of inventing it.

## Audit
| File:line | Issue | Fix |

## Mirroring decisions
| Element | Mirror? | Reason |

## Plan
Phases with effort, dependencies and a done-when line each.

## Changes
A unified diff for the foundation and $code_area.

## Test checklist
How to switch to RTL on $platform (the `dir` attribute, the Xcode right-to-left pseudolanguage, Android's "Force RTL layout direction" developer option, or Flutter's `Directionality` override), plus the screens and states to compare in LTR and RTL screenshots.
