# Create a classroom review game

## Inputs

- `unit_content` (required): What the unit covered, e.g. key terms, facts, procedures, the unit's objectives, or pasted notes or a study guide.
- `grade_level` (required): Grade, age or course, e.g. "Grade 5", "Year 10 biology", "adult ESL".
- `format` (optional; one of: quiz-show, relay, escape, cards, any; default: any): Game format. Use any to let the prompt choose the best fit for the content.

Arguments fill these in order. If a required value is empty, take it from the user’s message or ask for it once.

<context>
A review game is retrieval practice in disguise. It works when every student has to retrieve every answer, not just the fastest hand in each team, when the questions cover the unit's important content at rising difficulty, and when wrong answers get corrected on the spot. It fails when it rewards speed and luck over knowledge, when three students do all the thinking, or when setup eats the lesson. The best formats need nothing more than paper, a board and a timer.

<task>
Create a review game for **$grade_level** in the **$format** format.

<unit_content>
$unit_content
</unit_content>

1. Choose the format. If it is "any", pick the one that best fits the content and say why in one sentence: quiz-show (Jeopardy-style board, good for broad factual coverage), relay (teams pass work along, good for multi-step procedures), escape (locked-room puzzle chain where each answer unlocks the next, good for connected ideas), cards (matching, sorting or "I have, who has", good for vocabulary and definitions).
2. Extract the 6 to 10 most important ideas, terms or procedures from the unit content and make sure the questions cover all of them.
3. Write questions in three difficulty tiers: recall (about 40%), apply or explain (about 40%), and challenge (about 20%). Mix formats (short answer, true or false with correction, solve, explain why, odd one out). Write enough for about 30 minutes of play.
4. Build in whole-class accountability: every student answers every question (mini whiteboards, team huddle then a random spokesperson, or all teams answer at once) rather than buzz-in speed.
5. Write the rules in numbered steps a class can follow, with scoring that rewards accuracy and lets teams that fall behind catch up (for example double points in the final round or wagers).
6. Give timing for each phase and a total, and the materials and setup in under 10 minutes of preparation.
7. Write the answer key, and for the apply and challenge questions, a one-line explanation the teacher can read out after the answer.
</task>

<constraints>
- Use only content from the unit given; do not add topics that were not taught. If the content is too thin for a game, say what is missing and ask for it.
- Check every answer. Avoid questions with more than one defensible answer unless the game accepts either.
- Teams are mixed and random or teacher-set; no picking captains or public elimination of individual students.
- No prizes that cost money or food rewards; points and small privileges are enough.
- Keep reading load suitable for $grade_level, and give an option for students who need questions read aloud.
- No technology unless the teacher mentions it; describe a paper version of any board or puzzle.
</constraints>
