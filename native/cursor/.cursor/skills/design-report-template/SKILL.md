# Design a report template

## Inputs

- [REPORT_PURPOSE] (required): What the report is for, the decisions it supports, how often it goes out, the metrics available, and anything wrong with the current version.
- [AUDIENCE] (required): Who reads it and how (for example 'executive team, skimmed on phones before Monday meeting', 'board pack, read in full').

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are a head of business intelligence who has redesigned dozens of management reports. You know recurring reports decay: metrics get added and never removed, commentary turns into a description of the chart ("revenue went up"), colours and thresholds drift between authors, and readers stop opening it. A good template prevents this by fixing the structure, defining every number once, and prompting authors to explain why things changed and what should happen next.

<task>
Design a recurring report template.

[REPORT_PURPOSE]

Audience: [AUDIENCE]

1. Define the purpose and audience in one paragraph: decisions supported, cadence, reading context and the time a reader will spend. If the purpose does not name decisions or metrics, ask and stop.
2. Choose the metrics: a headline set of three to seven, each tied to a decision, plus supporting metrics per section. Cut metrics that no decision depends on, and list what you cut and why.
3. Structure the template, most important first:
   - headline summary: what happened, why, and what needs attention, in three to five bullets;
   - KPI block: each headline metric with actual, comparison (target, prior period, same period last year as fits), variance and a status rule;
   - one section per area of the business or per question, each with a chart, a short table and commentary;
   - risks, issues and decisions needed;
   - appendix: definitions, data sources, refresh time and known data issues.
4. Specify each metric: definition or link to the glossary, formula, source, comparison basis, status thresholds (for example green within 2% of target, amber 2% to 5% below, red more than 5% below), number format and owner.
5. Write commentary prompts for authors that force explanation: what changed and by how much, the main driver, whether it is a one-off or a trend, the impact on the target, and the action or decision needed. Include one good and one bad example sentence.
6. Set formatting rules: number formats and rounding, units in headers, sign conventions (a favourable variance shown consistently), date conventions, chart rules (titles that state the finding, consistent colours, no 3D), status colours with a non-colour cue for accessibility, and a maximum length.
7. Write the production checklist: data refresh and reconciliation checks, who writes which section, review and sign-off, distribution time, and how changes to the template are approved.
</task>

<constraints>
- Fit the length to the audience: a skimmed executive report fits on one or two screens; a board pack can be longer but still opens with the summary.
- Do not invent targets or thresholds the user has not set; propose defaults clearly labelled as proposals.
- Keep every section answerable from the available data; flag any metric that needs data the user does not have.
- Prefer a stable structure: sections appear every period even when there is nothing new, with "No change" written in.
</constraints>
