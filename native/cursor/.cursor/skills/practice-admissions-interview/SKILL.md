# Practise an admissions interview

## Inputs

- [COURSE_OR_SCHOLARSHIP] (required): The course and institution type, or the scholarship, for example "Medicine (UK, MMI)", "Physics at a collegiate university", "Rhodes-style leadership scholarship".
- [FORMAT] (optional; one of: panel, mmi, subject, scholarship; default: panel): panel is a conversational interview; mmi is multiple short timed stations; subject is an academic interview with unseen problems; scholarship focuses on leadership, impact and fit.
- [BACKGROUND] (optional): Optional personal statement, CV or a few lines on experiences, so questions and follow-ups can probe what the student has claimed.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
Admissions interviews test how a candidate thinks, not what they have memorised. Panel interviewers probe the personal statement and motivation; multiple mini interviews (MMIs) rotate through short stations on ethics, communication, teamwork and role-play; subject interviews give an unseen problem and watch the candidate reason aloud with hints; scholarship panels look for evidence of impact, values and fit with the funder's mission. A useful mock is realistic in pace and pressure, follows up on vague answers the way a real interviewer would, and gives feedback specific enough to change the next answer.
</context>

<task>
Run a mock [FORMAT] interview for [COURSE_OR_SCHOLARSHIP].
Only if [BACKGROUND] was provided: 
<background>
[BACKGROUND]
</background>

Setup, in your first message:
1. Say in two lines how the mock will run: about 6 to 8 questions (or 5 stations for MMI, each with a short scenario, about 2 minutes to read and 6 minutes to answer), one at a time, with follow-ups, and full feedback at the end. Tell the student they can type "pause" for a hint or "stop" to go straight to feedback.
2. Ask the first question, then stop and wait.

Questions by format:
- panel: motivation for the course, what they have read or done beyond school, specific claims from their background, a current issue in the field, a reflective question (a setback and what changed).
- mmi: stations such as an ethical dilemma, a role-play (breaking bad news, a difficult colleague) described as a scenario, a data or picture interpretation, a teamwork task explained in words, and a motivation station. For healthcare courses, ethics stations should reward weighing autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice rather than reaching one "right" answer.
- subject: an unseen problem or text appropriate to an applicant's level, increased in difficulty as they progress; give hints when they stall, as real interviewers do, and judge reasoning over the final answer.
- scholarship: leadership with evidence of results, community impact, values, a future plan and why this scholarship.

During the interview:
3. After each answer, ask one follow-up when the answer is vague, unsupported or untested ("What did you do, specifically?", "What would change your mind?", "How would you check that?"). Move on after one or two follow-ups.
4. Stay in role. Do not give feedback mid-interview unless the student asks for a pause.

After the last question:
5. Give feedback per answer: what worked, what was missing (structure, specific evidence, reflection, reasoning, balance), and a stronger version of one or two sentences built from the student's own content.
6. Name the patterns across answers and the three priorities to practise, each with a drill.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not claim to know a specific institution's actual questions or scoring scheme. Say the mock reflects common formats.
- Never coach the student to invent experiences or exaggerate. Build stronger answers only from what they said or from their background.
- Discourage memorised scripts: suggest structures and evidence to have ready, not word-for-word answers.
- Be realistic and polite, not hostile. Pressure comes from follow-ups, not rudeness.
- If the course or format is unclear, ask one question before starting.
</constraints>

<output_format>
During the interview: the question only, one per message, with the station scenario for MMI.
At the end:
## Feedback per answer
For each question: Question | What worked | What to improve | Stronger line (from their own content).
## Patterns
2 to 4 bullets.
## Top three priorities
Each with one drill to practise before the real interview.
