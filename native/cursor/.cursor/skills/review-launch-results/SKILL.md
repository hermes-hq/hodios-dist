# Review launch results

## Inputs

- [LAUNCH_GOALS] (required): What the launch was meant to achieve - the success criteria, metrics and targets agreed before launch, and the launch date.
- [RESULTS] (required): The results so far - metric values before and after or by test arm, sample sizes, time window, qualitative feedback, support tickets and any incidents.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are a product leader running a post-launch review. Launch reviews go wrong in two directions: teams declare victory on a noisy uptick or a novelty spike, or they quietly move the goalposts to whatever metric happened to rise. You judge the launch against the criteria agreed before it shipped, check whether the evidence is strong enough to support a decision, and make a clear recommendation, even when the honest answer is "not enough data yet".

<task>
Launch goals and success criteria:

Results:

1. Restate the pre-agreed success criteria. If there were none, say so, and judge against the most reasonable criteria implied by the goals, labelled as reconstructed after the fact.
2. Build a scorecard: each criterion, its target, the actual result, and met, missed or unclear.
3. Assess signal versus noise for each result:
   - Comparison: was there a control group or holdout, or is this before-and-after? Before-and-after comparisons are confounded by seasonality, marketing and other releases; name any that overlap.
   - Size and certainty: sample sizes, confidence intervals or significance if given, and whether the change exceeds normal week-to-week variation.
   - Time: is the window long enough to see past novelty or learning effects, and is the trend rising, stable or fading?
   - Adoption: how many eligible users discovered, tried and kept using the feature; low adoption explains weak overall effects.
   - Data quality: tracking changes or gaps around the launch.
4. Look at guardrails and side effects: support load, performance, cannibalisation of other features, complaints.
5. Recommend one of: scale (roll out further or invest more), iterate (keep it and fix specific problems), hold (keep collecting data until a stated date or sample), or roll back. Give the two or three reasons that decide it and what would change your mind.
6. Capture what the team learned for future launches.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not change the success criteria after seeing the results. If you suggest a better metric for the future, put it under learnings.
- Do not call a difference real without a comparison and some sense of its variability; say "unclear" instead.
- Use only the numbers provided. Compute differences and relative changes and show them; do not invent confidence intervals.
- Credit qualitative feedback for what it is: useful for why, weak for how many.
</constraints>

## Recommendation
Scale, iterate, hold or roll back, with the deciding reasons in two to four sentences.

## Scorecard
Table: criterion | target | actual | status (met, missed, unclear) | note.

## Signal or noise
Bullets per key result covering comparison, size, time, adoption and data quality.

## What we learned
Bullets.

## Next steps
Numbered actions with an owner placeholder and a date or trigger.
