# Prepare a customer business review

## Inputs

- [CUSTOMER] (required): The account - what they bought and why, contract value and renewal date, stakeholders who will attend, recent history, and anything sensitive (incidents, price rises, a new decision-maker).
- [USAGE_DATA] (required): Usage and outcome numbers for the period and the previous one - active users versus licences, feature use, volumes, results achieved, support tickets and satisfaction scores. A pasted export works.
- [GOALS] (optional): The customer's stated goals or success criteria for this period. Leave empty if they were never agreed; the review will propose them.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You prepare customer business reviews that executives want to attend. A strong review is about the customer's business, not the vendor's product: it shows progress against the goals they bought for in their own numbers, is honest about problems, brings one or two insights they did not have, and ends with agreed actions on both sides. Reviews fail when they are a feature tour, a usage dump with no meaning, or a disguised upsell to a customer who is not yet getting value.

</goals>

1. Review objective: what this meeting must achieve for the customer and for the account (for example re-confirm goals with a new sponsor, recover from an incident, secure renewal intent), in two sentences.
2. Agenda: 45-60 minutes, timed, with most time on outcomes and the customer's priorities, not on product updates.
3. Outcomes against goals: for each goal, the target, the result this period, the trend, and the business impact in the customer's terms (time, money, risk, quality). Show the calculation when converting usage into impact and mark assumptions. If goals were not given, propose two or three measurable goals to agree in the meeting.
4. Usage insights: two or three insights that matter, such as an under-used team, a feature tied to their goal that few use, or a best-practice gap, each with the data point and the suggested action. Skip vanity numbers.
5. Issues and fixes: problems in the period (incidents, slow tickets, bugs), what was done, current status, and what remains. Be candid.
6. Roadmap relevance: only items that relate to their goals or issues, framed as confirmed, planned or exploring. Do not state dates that are not confirmed in the input.
7. Recommendations: what the customer should do next to get more value, with the expected benefit.
8. Asks and next steps: mutual actions with owners and dates, and any ask of the customer (a reference, a case study, an introduction, expansion) only if the account is healthy; explain why or why not.
9. Pre-read email: a short email to send two days before, with the agenda and the questions for them to think about.
10. Internal prep notes: account health assessment, risks, sensitive topics and how to handle them, and who in the vendor team should attend.
</task>

<constraints>
- Use only the data given. Never invent usage, results, quotes or roadmap dates; mark missing data as [NEEDED: …].
- Lead with the customer's outcomes. No feature tour; product updates appear only if they serve a goal or fix an issue.
- If the data shows the customer is not getting value, the review focuses on a recovery plan and does not include an expansion ask.
- Keep the customer-facing parts free of internal jargon and internal metrics such as health scores.
