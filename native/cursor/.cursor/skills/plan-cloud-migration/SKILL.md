# Plan a cloud migration

## Inputs

- [INVENTORY] (required): The workloads to move, with for each what you know - purpose, owner, tech stack, OS, data size, dependencies, criticality, licensing and current hosting.
- [TARGET_CLOUD] (required): The destination, for example AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or a specific region or landing zone.
- [CONSTRAINTS] (optional): Fixed constraints, such as a data-centre contract end date, compliance and data residency, downtime windows, budget, team skills and licences that do not move.
- [TIMELINE] (optional): Target dates or the time available, for example "exit the data centre by June 2027".

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
Cloud migrations overrun for the same reasons: an inventory that misses the dependencies (a nightly job on a forgotten server, a hard-coded IP, a shared database), latency-sensitive pairs split across the data centre and the cloud for months, every workload treated as "lift and shift" or every workload treated as a rewrite, no landing zone ready before wave one, cutovers with no tested rollback, and a cloud bill nobody modelled. The standard frame is the "6 Rs" for each workload: rehost (lift and shift), replatform (lift and reshape, such as moving to a managed database), repurchase (replace with SaaS), refactor or re-architect, retire, and retain (keep where it is for now); AWS adds a seventh, relocate, for moving virtualised estates as-is. Waves are ordered by dependencies and risk: start with low-risk workloads that build the team's skills and the platform, and move tightly coupled groups together.

1. Check the inventory for gaps that block planning: missing owners, dependencies, data sizes, criticality or licensing. List them, and continue with labelled assumptions; if the inventory is too thin to plan at all, ask for the minimum fields and stop.
2. Classify each workload with one of the Rs and a one-line reason. Prefer retire for anything with no clear owner or usage evidence (to be confirmed), retain for workloads blocked by licensing, hardware or compliance, rehost when the deadline dominates, replatform when a managed service removes real operational work, and refactor only where there is a business case beyond the move. Flag licences that may not transfer (for example per-core database or OS licences) for checking.
3. Map dependencies: which workloads call which, share databases or file systems, or depend on on-premises services (directory, DNS, mainframe, file shares). Identify groups that must move together because of latency or chatty traffic, and the hybrid connectivity needed in the meantime (VPN or dedicated interconnect, DNS, identity).
4. Plan waves: wave 0 for the landing zone (accounts or subscriptions, networking, identity, security baselines, logging, backup, cost tagging) and a pilot; then waves ordered by dependency groups, rising risk and criticality, with the most critical systems after the team has done several cutovers. Give each wave its workloads, R, rough duration, entry criteria and exit criteria. Fit the waves to the timeline and say plainly if it is not realistic.
5. For each wave, define cutover and rollback: data migration method (replication, backup and restore, offline transfer for large volumes, with the transfer time calculated from data size and bandwidth), the freeze window, the cutover steps, validation checks, the go or no-go criteria, how traffic switches (DNS with lowered TTLs ahead of time, load balancer weights), and the rollback trigger, steps and point of no return.
6. Add cost checks: what to estimate before each wave with the provider's pricing calculator (compute right-sized from measured utilisation rather than on-premises allocation, storage, data transfer and egress, licensing, the period of running both environments in parallel), and post-migration checks to compare actual against estimate.
7. List prerequisites and organisational work: skills and training, runbooks, monitoring in the new environment, security and compliance sign-offs, and decommissioning of old hardware and contracts.

<constraints>
- Do not invent prices, instance types, service limits or data sizes. Show how to estimate them and mark every number you did not get as an assumption.
- Do not recommend refactoring a workload just because it is moving; tie every refactor to a stated benefit.
- Do not split tightly coupled, latency-sensitive workloads across environments without stating the latency risk and the mitigation.
- Use [TARGET_CLOUD]'s own service names where you are confident of them; otherwise describe the service generically.
- Separate what you verified from what you inferred. Mark inferences as such.
- When you do not know, say "I don't know" once and state what would settle it.
