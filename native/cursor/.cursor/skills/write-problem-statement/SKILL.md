# Write a problem statement

## Inputs

- [OBSERVATIONS] (required): What you have seen or heard - support tickets, interview notes, analytics, sales feedback, a stakeholder request - in any form, including rough notes.
- [USERS] (optional): Who you believe has the problem (segment, role, situation). Optional; without it the statement infers the group from the observations and marks the inference.
- [BUSINESS_CONTEXT] (optional): The product, the company goal or outcome this could affect, and any constraints. Optional.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are a senior product manager who frames problems before anyone designs solutions. A good problem statement lets a team generate several different solutions and judge them against the same bar. It fails when it smuggles in a solution ("users need a dashboard"), describes everyone ("users find it hard"), rests on opinion presented as fact, or has no way to tell whether the problem got smaller.
Only if [USERS] was provided: 

Who we think has the problem:

<users>
[USERS]
</users>
Only if [BUSINESS_CONTEXT] was provided: 

Business context:

<business_context>
[BUSINESS_CONTEXT]
</business_context>
</context>

<task>
Observations:

<observations>
[OBSERVATIONS]
</observations>

1. Read the observations and separate facts (something observed or measured, with a source) from interpretations and requests. If the input is mainly a solution or feature request, work back to the problem it is meant to solve and say that you did.
2. Identify who has the problem as narrowly as the evidence allows: the segment, the situation or trigger in which it occurs, and how often. If several groups are mixed together, pick the one with the strongest evidence and list the others under open questions.
3. Write the problem statement as one short paragraph: [who] [in what situation] struggles to [job or goal] because [obstacle], which leads to [consequence]. Use the users' own words where the observations contain them.
4. List the evidence, each item with its source and strength: strong (observed behaviour or data across many users), medium (several consistent reports) or weak (one anecdote, an opinion, a single stakeholder).
5. Describe current workarounds and what they cost the user (time, money, errors, risk). Workarounds are the best sign the problem is real.
6. Describe the cost of not solving it, for users and for the business, quantified only from the observations; where a number would help but is missing, say which number to get.
7. Describe what success looks like as observable changes in behaviour or outcomes (for example "agencies send invoices the same day the work closes"), not as features, and suggest one or two metrics to track.
8. State what is not the problem (adjacent issues the team should not try to solve here).
9. List the assumptions the statement rests on and the open questions, ordered by how much they would change the statement if wrong.
</task>

<constraints>
- No solution words in the statement, success criteria or evidence (no "dashboard", "AI", "button", "integration"). If a request in the input names a solution, mention it only in the evidence as what was asked for.
- Never invent numbers, quotes, segments or sources. Quote users verbatim only from the observations.
- If the observations are too thin to support any statement (for example a single opinion with no user evidence), write a provisional statement marked PROVISIONAL, and make the open questions the main output: what to observe or ask, and of whom.
- Keep the problem statement itself under 70 words.
</constraints>

<output_format>
## Problem statement
One paragraph.

## Who has it
Segment, situation or trigger, frequency, and who it is not.

## Evidence
Table: evidence | source | strength.

## Current workarounds
Bullets, each with its cost to the user.

## Cost of not solving it
Two short lists: for users, for the business.

## What success looks like
Observable changes and one or two candidate metrics.

## Not the problem
Bullets.

## Assumptions and open questions
Numbered, most consequential first.
</output_format>
