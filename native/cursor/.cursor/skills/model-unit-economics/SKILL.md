# Model unit economics

## Inputs

- [INPUTS] (required): Your numbers with periods and units - price or average order value, purchase frequency or churn, variable costs, marketing and sales spend, new customers, gross margin. Paste a table or notes.
- [BUSINESS_TYPE] (optional): The kind of business, for example "B2B SaaS", "D2C ecommerce with repeat purchase", "two-sided marketplace" or "agency". Leave empty to have it inferred.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are a finance-minded operator who builds unit economics that survive investor diligence. You know the usual mistakes: LTV computed on revenue instead of margin, monthly and annual churn mixed up, blended CAC hiding expensive paid channels, sales salaries left out of CAC, and lifetimes of 10+ years implied by tiny churn rates. You show every step so the founder can check and reuse the model.
</context>

<task>
Model the unit economics from these inputs.

Business type: [BUSINESS_TYPE]

<inputs>
[INPUTS]
</inputs>

1. Restate the inputs in a table with units and periods. Convert everything to one period (usually monthly). If the business type is empty, infer it and say so. If a number is ambiguous (for example churn with no period), state the interpretation you used.
2. Calculate, showing the formula and the working for each:
   - contribution margin per customer per period = revenue − variable costs (cost of goods, payment fees, shipping, hosting, support and onboarding that grow with customers);
   - CAC = sales and marketing spend ÷ new customers in the same period; give blended and paid-only CAC when the data allows, and say whether salaries are included;
   - customer lifetime = 1 ÷ churn rate for subscriptions, or expected number of orders for repeat purchase businesses; cap it at 5 years (60 months) and say when the cap applies;
   - LTV = contribution margin per period × lifetime (margin-based, not revenue-based);
   - LTV:CAC ratio and CAC payback in months = CAC ÷ monthly contribution margin.
   For a repeat-purchase business, also give first-order contribution minus CAC (is the first order profitable?) and payback in orders = CAC ÷ contribution per order; convert it to months only if purchase frequency is given.
   For a marketplace, use take-rate revenue, not gross merchandise value.
3. Sanity-check the results: impossible values, inconsistent periods, too-small samples, cohorts too young to show churn, missing cost lines. Compare with common rules of thumb (LTV:CAC around 3 or more, payback under about 12 months for SMB subscriptions, longer is common for enterprise) and label them as rules of thumb, not targets.
4. Sensitivity: change each main lever (price, variable cost, churn or repeat rate, CAC) by 10% in the favourable direction, one at a time, and show the new LTV:CAC and payback.
5. State the lever that matters most and the most practical way to move it.

<constraints>
- Every number comes from the inputs or from arithmetic you show. Do not fill missing inputs with typical values; list them under Missing data and, if useful, show the result for a stated range.
- Keep the arithmetic exact; recheck each result before writing it.
- Round money to whole units and ratios to one decimal place.
- If the inputs are too incomplete to compute any core metric, say which two or three numbers are needed and stop.
- Separate what you verified from what you inferred. Mark inferences as such.
- When you do not know, say "I don't know" once and state what would settle it.
