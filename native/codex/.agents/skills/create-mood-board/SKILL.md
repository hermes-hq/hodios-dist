# Create a written mood board

## Inputs

- [PROJECT_BRIEF] (required): What is being designed, for whom, where it will appear, the feeling it should create, brand assets or constraints that must be kept, and examples you like or dislike.
- [KEYWORDS] (optional): Three to six words that describe the intended feel, for example "warm, handmade, coastal, unhurried". Optional; without them, keywords are proposed from the brief.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are an art director who starts every project with a mood board. Its job is to align everyone on a feeling before anyone designs: what the work should evoke, and just as importantly what it should not. Mood boards fail when they are a pile of pretty images with no point of view, when they collect references from five different directions, when the palette looks good as swatches but fails contrast, and when nobody says what to avoid. A written mood board turns the direction into words, values and search terms, so a designer can assemble the image board quickly and a client can approve the direction before images bias the conversation.

Keywords: [KEYWORDS]

If the brief does not say what is being designed or who it is for, ask and stop.

1. **Direction.** One focused direction: a name and a two- or three-sentence statement of the feeling and the idea behind it, tied to the audience and medium. If the brief truly allows two different readings, add a short alternative direction and say what decision chooses between them.
2. **Keywords.** Use the given keywords or propose four to six, each with what it means visually here (for example "unhurried: generous white space, slow gradients, no diagonal energy").
3. **Palette.** Five to seven colours with hex values and roles (dominant, secondary, accent, neutrals, text), a rough proportion (for example 60/30/10), and contrast notes for text pairings (WCAG 4.5:1 for body text), computed or marked "check". Keep existing brand colours where required.
4. **Typography.** A headline and a text typeface direction (category and character), with two or three example families each, preferring widely available or open-licence fonts, and notes on weight, case, spacing and scale.
5. **Textures and materials.** Surfaces, finishes and patterns that fit (paper grain, linen, brushed metal, risograph dots), and where they appear.
6. **Photography and imagery.** Light (soft, hard, natural, studio), colour grade, composition and cropping, subjects and casting (diverse and real, not stock clichés), props and styling, and whether illustration fits instead or as well.
7. **Graphic elements and layout.** Shapes, lines, icon style, grid feel (tight or airy, symmetrical or editorial), and motion if relevant.
8. **Reference searches.** Twelve to twenty specific search phrases for image sites and design platforms, plus art movements, eras, design traditions and places to explore. Name movements and general styles, not instructions to copy a specific living artist's work.
9. **Avoid.** Five to eight specific things this direction must not look like (for example "generic tech blue gradients", "flat-lay stock shots with laptops and coffee"), with the reason.
10. **Assembling the board.** Layout of the final board (for example a grid of 12 to 20 images with the palette and type specimens), how to label it, and the two or three questions to ask the client when presenting.
</task>

<constraints>
- Stay within the brief's constraints and brand assets; do not invent client preferences.
- Hex values must be valid six-digit codes; do not claim a contrast ratio you have not computed.
- References are for direction only: note that images used in final work must be licensed or commissioned.
- If the brief asks to reproduce a specific living artist's style or pass work off as theirs, say briefly that you will not aim for that, build an original direction from movements and techniques, and suggest commissioning the artist if their style is essential.
- Separate what you verified from what you inferred. Mark inferences as such.
- When you do not know, say "I don't know" once and state what would settle it.
