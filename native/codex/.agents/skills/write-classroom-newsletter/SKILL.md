# Write a classroom newsletter

## Inputs

- [WEEK_NOTES] (required): Rough notes on what happened and what is coming, e.g. topics taught, highlights, upcoming dates, things to bring, reminders.
- [GRADE_LEVEL] (optional): Optional grade or age, so home activities fit, e.g. "Kindergarten", "Grade 5", "Year 8 science".
- [LANGUAGES_AT_HOME] (optional): Optional languages families speak, e.g. "Spanish, Arabic, Vietnamese", so the text is written to translate cleanly.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
Families read class newsletters on a phone, between other things, often through a translation tool. They want three answers fast: what is my child learning, what do I need to do or bring and when, and how can I help at home. Newsletters that bury dates in paragraphs, use school jargon ("WIN block", "CFU", "phonics phase 3") or idioms that translate badly do not get acted on. Short sections, concrete dates, and one easy home activity do.
</context>

<task>
Write a classroom newsletter from these notesOnly if [GRADE_LEVEL] was provided:  for [GRADE_LEVEL].

<week_notes>
[WEEK_NOTES]
</week_notes>
Only if [LANGUAGES_AT_HOME] was provided: Families speak: [LANGUAGES_AT_HOME]. Write so the text translates cleanly.

1. Start with the dates and actions families must not miss, in a short list: what, when (day and date written out, with time), and what to do.
2. **What we learned:** 2 to 4 topics in plain words, each with one sentence on why it matters or what students did.
3. **Try this at home:** one or two 5 to 10 minute activities that need no purchases and work in any language (a question to ask at dinner, a game with household objects, noticing something on a walk). Fit them to the grade.
4. **Celebrations:** class-level highlights; no individual student achievements unless the notes say families agreed.
5. **Reminders:** anything else, briefly.
6. Close with how to contact the teacher and a warm one-line sign-off.
</task>

<constraints>
- Under about 300 words for the newsletter body. Short sentences, one idea each, and headings families can scan.
- Plain language at roughly a primary-school reading level: no idioms, sarcasm, slang or school acronyms; if a school term is unavoidable, explain it in a few words.
- Write dates unambiguously (for example "Friday 14 March, 2:30 pm" or "Friday, March 14, 2:30 pm", following the format in the notes) and never only "next Friday".
- Do not name or picture individual students, mention grades, behaviour or support needs, or share anything about one family.
- Use only facts in the notes. If a date, time or detail is missing for an action families must take, put a bracketed placeholder like [time] and list it under "Before you send".
- Keep the tone warm and inclusive of all family structures ("families", "grown-ups at home", not only "mums and dads").
