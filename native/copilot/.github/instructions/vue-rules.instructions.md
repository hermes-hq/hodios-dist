description: Standing rules for Vue and Nuxt code covering the Composition API, typed props and emits, reactivity pitfalls, composables, stores and server versus client rendering in Nuxt.

Apply these rules to files matching: `**/*.vue`, `composables/**`, `stores/**`, `server/**`, `nuxt.config.*`, `src/**/*.ts`.

When you write or change Vue or Nuxt code in this project:

**Know the project first**
- Check the Vue (and Nuxt, if present) version in `package.json` and follow the existing style. Some reactivity behaviour, such as whether destructured props stay reactive, depends on the version.

**Components**
- Write single-file components with `<script setup lang="ts">` and the Composition API. Do not add Options API components to a Composition API codebase.
- Declare props with type-based `defineProps<...>()` and defaults through the version's supported mechanism, and emits with typed `defineEmits<...>()`. Use `defineModel` for two-way binding where the version supports it, instead of hand-written prop and emit pairs.
- Never mutate a prop. Emit an event or use a local copy that is explicitly an initial value.
- Give every `v-for` a stable `:key` from the data. Do not put `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element; filter in a computed property or wrap in a `<template>`.

**Reactivity**
- Use `ref` for primitives and values you replace; use `reactive` only for objects you mutate in place and never reassign. Pick one style per file.
- Do not destructure a `reactive` object or a store directly; you lose reactivity. Use `toRefs` or `storeToRefs`.
- Derive values with `computed`, never with a `watch` that copies state into another ref. Use `watch` and `watchEffect` only for side effects, and clean up timers and listeners in `onUnmounted` or the watcher's cleanup.
- Do not store component instances, DOM nodes or large immutable data in deep reactive state; use `shallowRef` or `markRaw`.

**Composables**
- Put reusable stateful logic in composables named `useSomething` that accept refs or getters and return refs. A composable that adds listeners or timers removes them when the calling component unmounts.
- Keep composables free of component-specific DOM assumptions so they also run during server rendering.

**State and stores**
- Keep state local until two distant components need it, then use the project's store (Pinia in most projects). Stores hold state and actions, not UI concerns. Do not access a store at module top level outside a component or composable.

**Templates and security**
- Never bind untrusted content with `v-html`. Sanitise it with an allow-list sanitiser first, or render it as text.
- Use semantic elements, labelled form controls and real buttons for actions.

**Nuxt: server and client rendering**
- Fetch data during setup with `useFetch` or `useAsyncData` so it is fetched once on the server and reused on the client. Use `$fetch` directly only in event handlers and server code; calling it bare in setup fetches twice.
- Give `useAsyncData` a unique, stable key, and handle `pending` and `error` states in the template.
- Avoid hydration mismatches: no `Date.now()`, random values, `window`, `localStorage` or locale-dependent formatting in rendered output on the server. Wrap browser-only components in `<ClientOnly>` and guard browser code with `import.meta.client` or `onMounted`.
- Read configuration through `useRuntimeConfig()`. Only `public` runtime config reaches the browser; keep secrets in the private part and use them only in `server/` routes.
- Put backend endpoints in `server/api` and validate their input like any public API. Use route middleware for navigation guards, and remember client-side guards are not authorisation.

**Tests and checks**
- Test components with Vue Test Utils or Testing Library through user-visible behaviour, and composables as plain functions.
- Before finishing, run the type check (`vue-tsc` or `nuxi typecheck`), lint and tests, and load the page with server rendering to check for hydration warnings in the console.
