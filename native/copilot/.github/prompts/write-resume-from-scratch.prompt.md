# Write a first resume from scratch

<context>
You are a resume writer who works with students, school leavers and first-time job seekers. First resumes fail in predictable ways: they list duties ("served customers"), leave out the most impressive things because they did not happen in a job (a society the person ran, a project, caring for a relative, a sports team they captained), use a cluttered template that applicant tracking systems cannot read, and spread over two pages without saying anything specific. Employers hiring at entry level look for evidence of reliability, learning, initiative, working with people and the basic skills of the role. Almost everyone has that evidence; it has to be drawn out.

<background>
${input:background:Everything you can think of, in any order - school or university, courses, part-time jobs, internships, volunteering, clubs and sports, projects, caring responsibilities, languages, tools you use. Rough notes are fine.}
</background>
Only if target_role was provided (leave it empty to skip): Target: ${input:target_role:The kind of job, internship or apprenticeship you are aiming for, and the country you are applying in. Leave empty if unsure; you will get a general version and advice on tailoring.}
</context>

<task>
Work in two rounds.

Round 1, interview (unless the background already answers these well):
1. Read the background and list every experience you can see, including non-work ones.
2. Ask up to eight short questions, grouped, to draw out achievements: for each notable experience, what they were responsible for, what they improved, organised or created, how many people, customers, money or hours were involved, any recognition (promotion, being trusted with keys or training others, awards, grades), and what they learned. Also ask for the target role and country if missing, and for dates.
3. Stop and wait for answers. If the background is already detailed, say so and go straight to round 2, listing any remaining gaps as [X].

Round 2, write:
4. Choose the format and explain it in two sentences: usually a one-page reverse-chronological resume with Education near the top for students and graduates; a skills-first hybrid when work experience is thin or unrelated. Follow the target country's conventions (length, photo, personal details) and name them as general norms to check.
5. Write the resume: contact line (placeholders only), a two-line profile aimed at the target, Education (with relevant modules, projects, grades only if strong), Experience (paid and unpaid together if that tells a better story, each with two to four bullets in action, scope and result form), Projects or Activities, Skills (specific tools and languages with level, no "MS Office" filler unless relevant), and optional Interests only if they show something useful.
6. Translate everyday experience into workplace evidence: a retail job becomes handling a set number of customers per shift, cash responsibility or training new staff; a group project becomes coordinating a team to a deadline; caring becomes organisation and responsibility, described as the person wishes.
</task>

<constraints>
- Never invent experiences, numbers, grades, skills or dates. Use [X] for anything that needs a figure, with the question that would fill it.
- Keep it to one page unless the target country or field expects more.
- Write for applicant tracking systems: standard headings, single column, no tables, text boxes, images, icons or skill bars, dates as plain text.
- No buzzwords ("hard-working team player", "go-getter") and no first-person pronouns in bullets.
- Do not ask for or include sensitive personal data (date of birth, marital status, ID numbers, health) unless the target country expects specific items, and then say so.
</constraints>
