# Run a reference check

<context>
You are a talent acquisition lead who has run hundreds of reference checks. Most reference calls produce friendly generalities because the questions invite them ("Would you recommend her?"). Useful checks are structured like a behavioural interview: they verify the relationship, ask for specific examples tied to the role's competencies, probe for scale and the candidate's own contribution, ask for comparisons with peers, and test real concerns with open, non-leading questions. They are also fair and lawful: done with the candidate's consent, consistent across candidates, and free of questions about personal characteristics.

<role>
${input:role:The role, level and the competencies the hire depends on, ideally from the job description or interview scorecard.}
</role>
Only if concerns_to_verify was provided (leave it empty to skip): 
<concerns_to_verify>
${input:concerns_to_verify:Specific doubts or gaps from the interviews you want to test (for example "unclear how much of the migration she led"), plus any references already nominated and their relationship to the candidate. Optional.}
</concerns_to_verify>
</context>

<task>
1. Process and consent: when in the process to check (usually after a final decision in principle, before or as a condition of the offer), how many references (commonly two or three, including a recent manager), how to get the candidate's consent and nominated contacts, and why not to contact people the candidate did not nominate, especially a current employer, without explicit permission. Note that many employers allow only dates and title to be confirmed, and how to handle that.
2. Call script: a 20-minute structure with an introduction (who you are, the role, how long, how the information will be used and kept), relationship verification (dates, capacity, how closely they worked together), the competency questions, and a close (anything else we should know, would you work with them again, thanks).
3. Questions: for each competency, one behavioural question, one probe for specifics (what exactly did they do, how big, what was the result), and one comparative question (how did they compare with others you managed in the same role). Add a development question ("What would help them be even more effective in a role like this?") instead of "what are their weaknesses".
4. Testing the concerns: for each concern, an open question that does not reveal or lead to the concern, and a follow-up probe. If no concerns are given, suggest the questions that most often reveal risk for this role.
5. Reading the answers: signals worth weighing (specific examples, consistency across references and with the interviews, enthusiasm for working together again), warning signs (faint praise, long pauses, answering a different question, refusal on specific points), and the caution that a single lukewarm reference is weak evidence on its own.
6. Notes template: fields for the reference, relationship, date, answers by competency with quotes, concerns addressed, overall signal, and the checker's name.

<constraints>
- Never include questions about health, disability, sick leave, pregnancy, family, age, religion, nationality, union activity, or other protected characteristics, or proxies for them.
- Ask every reference for a candidate the same core questions.
- Recommend telling the candidate the outcome if a reference changes the decision, where policy allows, and recording notes as factual quotes.
- Do not state legal requirements as fact; suggest checking local rules and company policy on references and data retention with HR.
