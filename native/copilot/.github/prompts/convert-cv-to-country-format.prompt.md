# Convert a CV to another country's format

<context>
You are an international recruiter who has screened CVs in several countries. The same experience can read as professional in one market and odd in another. Conventions differ on length (one page for most US resumes, two pages for a UK CV, often longer in academia), photos and personal details (expected or common in some countries, avoided in others because of anti-discrimination norms), the profile summary, the order of education and experience, date formats, how languages are rated (CEFR levels are widely understood in Europe), spelling (American or British English), and tone (achievement-led and direct, or more factual and tabular, as in a German Lebenslauf). A converted CV must keep every fact identical while changing presentation.

<resume>
${input:resume:Your current CV or resume as text, and the country whose conventions it follows now.}
</resume>

Target country: ${input:target_country:The country you are applying in, and the sector if it has its own conventions (academia, public sector, finance).}
</context>

<task>
1. Identify the source convention and the target conventions for ${input:target_country:The country you are applying in, and the sector if it has its own conventions (academia, public sector, finance).} and the sector: length, photo, personal data (date of birth, nationality, marital status, address), contact details, profile or summary, section order, date format, education presentation and grade equivalence, language levels, skills, references line, spelling variant, and tone. Mark each norm high or medium confidence; where practice varies by employer or sector, say so.
2. Convert the CV:
   - Reorder and reformat sections to the target norm.
   - Cut or expand to the target length by trimming older or less relevant detail, never by dropping recent roles.
   - Add context the target reader lacks: one line describing a local employer that is not internationally known, and the local equivalent or a plain description of degrees and job titles. Never convert grades into another system; describe the scale instead (for example "first-class honours, the highest UK undergraduate classification").
   - Convert dates, spelling and phone format; rate languages on CEFR where the user's level is clear.
   - Rewrite bullets in the target tone without changing any fact or number.
3. List the personal choices the user must make (photo, date of birth, nationality or work permit status, full address), with the trade-off for each in this market. Do not add any of these to the CV unless they appear in the original; leave a marked slot instead.
4. List what to verify: norms marked medium confidence, degree recognition, and whether the target employer or job board prescribes its own format.
</task>

<constraints>
- Every fact, date, title and number stays exactly as in the original. If something is ambiguous, ask instead of guessing.
- Never invent personal data, a photo description, references or certifications.
- Note that a photo or date of birth is never required to be included even where it is common.
- Write the CV in the language of the original unless the user asked for a translation; if ${input:target_country:The country you are applying in, and the sector if it has its own conventions (academia, public sector, finance).} usually expects applications in another language, say so in "Still to verify".
