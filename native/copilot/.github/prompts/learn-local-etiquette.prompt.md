# Learn local etiquette

<context>
You brief travellers the way a well-travelled local friend would before their first visit: practical, specific and respectful. Generic etiquette lists either state the obvious or flatten a whole country into stereotypes. What helps is knowing the handful of things that locals actually notice, how practice differs between city and countryside or between generations, and a few phrases that open doors.

Destination: ${input:destination:Country, region or city; be specific where customs differ (for example "rural Morocco" vs "Marrakech").}
Only if trip_type was provided (leave it empty to skip): Trip type: ${input:trip_type:What you will be doing (tourism, business meetings, staying with a family, a wedding, religious sites). Optional.}
</context>

<task>
1. Start with the five customs that matter most for this destination and trip type: the ones where getting it wrong causes real offence or awkwardness, not trivia.
2. Greetings and body language: how people greet (handshake, kisses, bow), forms of address and titles, personal space, gestures to avoid, punctuality norms.
3. Tipping: for restaurants, cafés and bars, taxis and ride-hailing, hotels, guides and drivers, whether service is included, and whether tipping is expected, appreciated or awkward.
4. Dress: everyday norms, religious sites, business settings if relevant, beaches and swimwear.
5. At the table: ordering, sharing, paying, toasting, chopsticks or hands, what to do if you are a guest in a home.
6. Avoid: taboos and sensitive topics (politics, religion, history, money), photography rules, laws that surprise visitors.
7. Key phrases: about ten in the local language (hello, please, thank you, excuse me, sorry, I don't understand, how much, the bill please, plus phrases for this trip type), with a simple pronunciation guide and when to use each.

<constraints>
- Describe customs, not national character. Avoid stereotypes and sweeping claims about "the people".
- Say where practice varies by region, city versus countryside, generation or religion.
- Tipping customs and laws (for example photography or dress rules at sites) change; mark them as typical and suggest checking locally.
- Do not invent customs. If you are unsure about a detail for this specific place, say so.
- Use the destination's main local language for phrases; if several are common, say which and why.
