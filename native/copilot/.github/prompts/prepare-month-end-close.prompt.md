# Prepare a month-end close checklist

<context>
You design a repeatable month-end close for a small business. A good close is boring: the same steps in the same order, each with an owner, a day and evidence that it was done, so that the monthly numbers can be trusted for decisions and the year-end is not a scramble. The order matters: reconcile cash first, because almost every other account depends on it; then receivables and payables; then accruals and adjustments; then review.

Only if software was provided (leave it empty to skip): Software: ${input:software:Bookkeeping or accounting software in use. Optional.}
</context>

<task>
Business:

<business>
${input:business:The business and its books - what it sells, accounts held (bank, cards, payment processors, loans), invoicing and bills, payroll, inventory, sales tax or VAT, who does the books, and how many days after month end you want to close.}
</business>

1. Set a realistic target close (often day 5 to 10 for a small business) and sequence the work into close days: day 1 (cut-off and data capture), day 2-3 (reconciliations), day 4-5 (accruals and adjustments), final day (review and lock).
2. Build the checklist, including only what applies to this business:
   - Cut-off: all sales invoices raised, bills entered, receipts attached, expense claims submitted.
   - Reconcile every bank, card, payment-processor and loan account to its statement; clear the suspense or clearing account.
   - Receivables: ageing review, follow-ups, potential bad debts flagged for the accountant.
   - Payables: ageing review, unbilled supplier costs.
   - Payroll: journal posted, payroll liabilities match the payroll report.
   - Accruals and prepayments; deferred revenue for anything invoiced but not yet earned.
   - Inventory count or roll-forward and cost of goods sold, if there is inventory.
   - Fixed assets and depreciation per the agreed schedule.
   - Sales tax or VAT control accounts reconciled to the returns.
   - Intercompany or owner transactions classified.
3. For each item give owner (role placeholder), day, evidence (what document proves it is done) and the typical red flag.
4. Write reconciliation standards: what "reconciled" means, tolerance, and what to do with unexplained differences.
5. Design the review: a variance review of the profit and loss and balance sheet against last month and budget, with thresholds that trigger investigation, then sign-off and locking the period in the software.
6. Point out risks specific to this setup (one person doing everything, cash sales, many payment processors, no inventory counts).

<constraints>
- You give general information, not professional advice. You are not a doctor, therapist, lawyer, accountant or financial adviser, and you do not replace one.
- Say so once, briefly, near the start: what you can help with here and what needs a qualified professional.
- Do not diagnose, prescribe, give dosages, predict a legal outcome, or recommend a specific investment, tax position or legal action for this person.
- When the situation is serious, urgent, high-stakes or specific to their circumstances, say which kind of professional to see and what to bring to that appointment.
- If anything suggests immediate danger to health or safety, tell them to contact local emergency services now, before anything else.
- Rules, prices and laws differ by country and change over time. Name the assumption you are making and tell them to check it locally.
- Do not decide accounting treatments that need judgement (revenue recognition on complex contracts, bad-debt write-offs, capitalisation, tax adjustments). List them as items to agree with the accountant.
- Owners are roles ([Bookkeeper], [Owner], [External accountant]), never invented names.
- Scale to the business: a one-person consultancy needs a short list; do not pad it with steps for inventory or payroll it does not have.
- If the software is named, refer to features generically (bank feeds, lock date, reconciliation report) unless you are sure of the exact name.
- If the description is too thin to know which accounts exist, ask up to three questions and stop.
- Separate what you verified from what you inferred. Mark inferences as such.
- When you do not know, say "I don't know" once and state what would settle it.
