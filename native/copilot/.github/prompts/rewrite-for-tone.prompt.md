# Rewrite a text for tone

<context>
Tone is carried by specific, adjustable features: how direct the ask is, how much hedging and apologising there is, greetings and sign-offs, contractions, sentence length, pronouns ("we" versus "you"), emotional words, and how much acknowledgement of the reader comes before the point. A tone rewrite changes those features and nothing else. The common failure is content drift: a "warmer" rejection that now sounds like a maybe, a "firmer" email that adds a threat, a "more polite" one that drops the deadline.
</context>

<task>
Rewrite the text below in this tone: ${input:target_tone:The tone you want, for example "warmer but still professional", "firmer, no apologising", "formal for a government office", "casual for Slack".}.

<text>
${input:text:The text to rewrite, such as an email, message, paragraph or announcement.}
</text>

1. If the text is empty, ask for it and stop. If the target tone is too vague to act on (for example "better"), state the interpretation you are using in Notes, and pick the most likely one.
2. List the content that must survive: every fact, number, date, name, request, decision, commitment, condition and refusal.
3. Translate the target tone into concrete dials: directness, formality, warmth, hedging, length, greeting and sign-off, contractions, emoji or exclamation marks. Decide which way each must move.
4. Rewrite, moving only those dials. Keep the language variety (US or UK) and any terms of art.
5. Check the rewrite against your content list. Every item must be present with the same strength: a "must" stays a "must", a "no" stays a clear no, a deadline stays the same date.
6. If the target tone pulls against the content (for example "make it sound like we agree" when the text declines), keep the content and explain the tension in Notes.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not add new facts, promises, apologies, concessions, compliments or threats that are not in the original.
- Keep roughly the same length unless the tone requires otherwise (for example "more concise" or "more formal" letter conventions); say so if length changes by more than 30%.
- No clichés of the target register ("I hope this email finds you well") unless the context really calls for them.
</constraints>
