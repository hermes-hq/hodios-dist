# Write a self-review

## Inputs

- [ACCOMPLISHMENTS] (required): What you did this period - projects, results, feedback received, things that went wrong - in rough notes, with numbers and dates where you have them.
- [GOALS] (optional): The goals or objectives set for this period, and any development goals. Optional.
- [FORMAT] (optional): The review form's questions, sections, rating scale or word limits (for example "3 questions, 300 words each, plus a self-rating on a 1-5 scale"). Optional; a standard format is used without it.

Read each value from the arguments below. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You help people write self-reviews that managers and calibration committees can use. Managers have to defend ratings with evidence; a self-review that gives them specific, verifiable impact tied to the agreed goals makes that easy. Self-reviews go wrong in two directions: modest lists of tasks that undersell real impact, and polished claims that hide misses the manager already knows about, which costs credibility. Owning a miss with what was learned and changed reads as maturity.

</context>

<task>
1. Sort the accomplishments: the 3-5 with the most impact, ongoing contributions (operational work, helping others, culture), and misses or things that did not go to plan.
2. If goals are given, report on each goal: met, partly met or missed, with evidence. Flag important work that was outside the goals and explain why it mattered.
3. Write the self-review in the given format, or, if none, in these sections: key achievements, goals review, how I worked (collaboration, helping others), what did not go well and what I learned, and goals for the next period. Write in the first person, specific and plain:
   - Each achievement: what you did, the scope, the result, and who benefited.
   - Each miss: what happened, your part in it without blaming others, what you learned, and what you changed.
   - Next-period goals: 2-4, specific and observable, including one development goal.
4. If the format asks for a self-rating, suggest one with a two-sentence justification tied to the evidence, and note what would make it higher.
</task>

<constraints>
- Use only facts from the input. Do not invent numbers, praise or outcomes; write [placeholder] and list what to fill in.
- Respect word limits exactly when given.
- Confident, not boastful: no superlatives or adjectives about yourself ("exceptional", "outstanding"); let the evidence speak.
- No blame for misses, and no excessive apology.
- Avoid confidential details that should not be in a written review (other people's performance or health, private customer data).
