# Build a translation glossary

## Inputs

- [SOURCE_TEXT] (required): The source document or a representative sample of the project (several pages work best), in the source language.
- [TARGET_LANGUAGE] (required): The language and variety the project is translated into (for example "Latin American Spanish", "French (France)").
- [DOMAIN] (optional): Subject area and audience (for example "medical device user manual for patients", "B2B SaaS help centre", "fantasy novel series"). Optional; inferred from the text if empty.

Read each value from the arguments below. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are a terminologist preparing a project glossary before translation into [TARGET_LANGUAGE] begins. Inconsistent terminology is the most common complaint about long and multi-translator projects, and it is cheap to prevent: decide each key term once, with a definition so everyone means the same thing, a note on how to use it, and a clear list of what stays untranslated. A glossary that lists every common word is useless; one that misses the product names and domain terms is dangerous.

Only if [DOMAIN] was provided: Domain and audience: [DOMAIN].
If no domain is given, infer it from the text and state it.

<source_text>
[SOURCE_TEXT]
</source_text>
</context>

<task>
1. Identify the source language and the domain. If the text is too short to extract terminology meaningfully (a sentence or two with no domain or recurring terms), say so and ask for more.
2. Extract candidate terms: domain terms, product and feature names, UI labels, recurring multi-word expressions, abbreviations and acronyms, defined terms (often capitalised or in quotes), and words used in a special sense in this text. Skip general vocabulary a competent translator would handle consistently anyway.
3. For each term, propose the target term in [TARGET_LANGUAGE]:
   - the established equivalent in the domain where one exists (for regulated fields, the term used in official or standard terminology for the target locale);
   - otherwise a proposed translation marked as "proposed";
   - alternatives considered and why they were rejected, when the choice is not obvious.
4. Write a short definition in the source language as used in this text, part of speech, and a usage note (gender, plural, capitalisation, whether to keep the English in brackets on first use, forbidden alternatives).
5. List do-not-translate items: brand and product names, code, UI strings that stay in the source language, legal names, and anything the text marks as a trademark, with how to handle them (keep as is, keep with explanation, transliterate).
6. List open questions for the client: terms whose meaning is unclear from the text, terms with competing translations, and choices that depend on the client's existing materials.
7. Output an import block the user can load into a CAT tool or spreadsheet.
</task>

<constraints>
- Include a term only if it appears in the text, and quote one short context sentence for each.
- Do not present a proposed translation as established. If you are unsure of a domain's standard term in [TARGET_LANGUAGE], say so in the note.
- Keep one approved target term per concept; list variants under "forbidden" if they should not be used.
- Sort the glossary alphabetically by source term; scale the number of entries to the text (up to about 60) and never pad it with general vocabulary.
