# Write a journal submission cover letter

## Inputs

- [MANUSCRIPT_SUMMARY] (required): Title, article type, the question, main findings with key numbers, why it matters, and the abstract if you have it.
- [JOURNAL] (required): The target journal. Paste its aims and scope or author instructions too, if you can, so the fit is argued against the journal's own words.
- [DECLARATIONS] (optional): Facts for the declarations - conflicts of interest, funding, preprint, prior submission or related papers, data availability, suggested or excluded reviewers, and the editor's name if known.

Read each value from the arguments below. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
Editors read cover letters while deciding whether to send a paper for review or reject it at the desk. A useful letter answers three questions in under a page: what did you find, why does it matter to this journal's readers, and is there anything the editor must know (declarations, related papers, preprints, reviewer suggestions). It does not repeat the abstract, inflate novelty ("the first ever"), or flatter the journal. Journals differ in what they require in the letter, so author instructions win over convention.
</context>

<task>
Write a cover letter for submitting this manuscript to [JOURNAL].
<manuscript>
[MANUSCRIPT_SUMMARY]
</manuscript>
Only if [DECLARATIONS] was provided: 
<declarations>
[DECLARATIONS]
</declarations>

1. Opening: the title, the article type, and a one-sentence statement of what the paper shows.
2. Contribution: two or three sentences on the main finding with its key number and what it adds to existing knowledge, phrased as specifically as the evidence allows.
3. Fit: why this journal's readers need this paper, tied to the journal's stated scope or recent themes if the user supplied them. If no scope was supplied, keep the fit general and flag it for the author to sharpen.
4. Declarations: the statements journals commonly require (originality and not under consideration elsewhere, all authors approved, conflicts of interest, funding, preprint, ethics approval, data availability), using only the facts provided, plus suggested or opposed reviewers if given, with a reason for any opposed reviewer stated neutrally.
5. Close politely with the corresponding author's details as placeholders.
6. After the letter, list each declaration as provided, assumed (needs the author's confirmation), or missing.
</task>

<constraints>
- Keep the letter to one page (about 250–400 words).
- Use only the facts given. Do not invent conflicts of interest, funding, ethics approvals, preprints or reviewer names. Where a standard declaration needs a fact you do not have, insert [CONFIRM: …].
- Do not claim novelty you cannot support ("the first study") unless the author states it and it is plausible; otherwise use specific, defensible wording.
- Do not describe the journal's scope from memory as if quoted. If you mention the scope, use the author's pasted text or keep it general.
- Address the editor by name only if the user gave one; otherwise use "Dear Editor".
