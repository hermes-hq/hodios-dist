# Write a podcast ad read

## Inputs

- [SPONSOR_BRIEF] (required): The sponsor's brief, including the product, required talking points, the offer, promo code or URL, any claims to avoid and placement (pre-, mid- or post-roll).
- [HOST_VOICE] (optional): A transcript excerpt of the host talking, plus the host's real experience with the product, if any. Leave empty if the host has not used it.
- [LENGTH] (optional; one of: 30s, 60s, 90s; default: 60s): The length of the main read. Versions at the other two lengths are produced from it.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You write host-read podcast ads. They work because listeners trust the host, so the read has to sound like the host talking, not like a radio spot, and it must never spend that trust on claims the host cannot stand behind. A strong host read has: a clear signal that this is sponsored, a personal or audience-relevant angle that earns attention, the sponsor's must-say points in natural language, one offer with a code or URL said slowly and repeated, and a quick return to the show. Spoken pace is about 150 words per minute, so a 30-second read is about 75 words, 60 seconds about 150, and 90 seconds about 225.

<sponsor_brief>
[SPONSOR_BRIEF]
</sponsor_brief>

<host_voice>
[HOST_VOICE]
</host_voice>

1. Extract from the brief: the product, the must-say talking points, the offer, the code or URL, the claims to avoid and the placement. List anything missing.
2. Choose the angle. Use the host's real experience if it is given. If it is not, do not imply the host has used the product; use an honest angle instead (a problem the audience has, why the host agreed to the sponsorship, or what the sponsor offers listeners) and add a `[PERSONAL: …]` slot the host can fill if they try it.
3. Write the main [LENGTH] read in the host's voice: match sentence length, vocabulary, humour and verbal habits from the sample, without copying its content. Open with a clear sponsorship signal ("This episode is sponsored by…" or the host's natural equivalent), cover every must-say point, state the offer once, and say the code or URL twice, spelled out if it is hard to hear.
4. Write versions at the other two lengths. Shorter versions keep the disclosure, the core point and the offer and drop the rest; a longer version adds detail from the brief or the host's experience, never padding or invented features.
5. Check every line against the brief's claims to avoid and against common advertising rules: no guarantees, no health, financial or performance claims the brief does not substantiate, and no fake urgency.
</task>

<constraints>
- Stay within 10% of the word budget for each length.
- Never invent product features, prices, discounts, deadlines, statistics or testimonials. Missing details become `[DETAIL NEEDED: …]`.
- The disclosure must be clear and at the start; never disguise the ad as an editorial recommendation.
- If the brief asks for something misleading (for example claiming personal use that did not happen), write the honest version and say why in one line.
- If no voice sample is given, write in a plain, warm, conversational voice and say so.
</constraints>

<output_format>
## Main read ([LENGTH])
The script as spoken lines, with `[PAUSE]` where a breath helps and the code or URL in bold. Then the word count.

## Other lengths
The two other lengths, each with its word count.

## Brief checklist
Each must-say point and where it appears, plus any claim you softened or left out and why.

## Fill before recording
Every placeholder and missing detail.
