# Write song lyrics

## Inputs

- [THEME] (required): What the song is about, the story or situation, the point of view, and the mood. Concrete details (a place, an object, a moment) help.
- [GENRE] (required): The genre or sound, e.g. "indie folk", "2000s pop-punk", "country ballad", "UK drill".
- [STRUCTURE] (optional; default: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus): Section order, comma-separated, using intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, post-chorus, bridge, hook, outro.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
Generated lyrics tend to sound alike: abstract feelings stated outright ("my heart is broken, I feel so lost"), forced rhymes that bend word order, lines of wildly different length that no melody can carry, and choruses with no hook. Good lyrics show the feeling through concrete images, put the title where the ear expects it, move the story forward from verse to verse, and are built to be sung: matched syllable counts between parallel lines, stressed syllables on strong beats, and open vowels on the long notes.

<task>
Write original [GENRE] lyrics about:

<theme>
[THEME]
</theme>

Structure: [STRUCTURE]

1. **Concept:** the song's title (which is also the hook), the point of view (I, you, we, a character), the one-sentence emotional arc, and the central image or metaphor. Say how each section will develop it: verse 1 sets the scene, verse 2 moves it forward or deepens it, the chorus states the core idea, the bridge gives a new angle or turn.
2. Match the conventions of [GENRE]: typical line length, rhyme density (perfect rhymes in pop and country, more slant and internal rhyme in hip-hop and indie), vocabulary register, and section lengths.
3. Write the lyrics following the structure exactly:
   - Use concrete, sensory details instead of naming emotions.
   - Put the title in the chorus at the first or last line, or both.
   - Keep a consistent rhyme scheme within each section type (for example ABAB in verses, AABB in choruses), and keep parallel lines within one or two syllables of each other.
   - Place natural word stress on the strong beats; never twist word order to reach a rhyme.
   - Prefer open vowels (as in "go", "way", "free") at the ends of lines that will be held.
   - Avoid stock phrases ("fire in my soul", "end of the road", "dance in the rain") unless twisted into something fresh.
   - Repeat the chorus with the same words, or with one deliberate change in the last chorus.
4. **Craft notes:** the rhyme scheme per section, syllable counts per line for the first verse and chorus, and where the hook lands.
5. **Alternatives:** 2 alternative chorus lines or titles, and the 2 weakest lines in the draft with a replacement for each.
6. If the theme is too vague to find a concrete story (for example "love"), choose a specific angle, state it in the concept, and offer a different angle in one line.
</task>

<constraints>
- Write original lyrics. Do not reproduce or closely paraphrase existing songs. If asked to write "in the style of" an artist, capture general traits (themes, imagery, rhyme habits, structure) without copying their lines or signature phrases.
- Keep content appropriate to the genre and the request; do not add explicit content that was not asked for.
- Label every section in square brackets, e.g. [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Bridge].
