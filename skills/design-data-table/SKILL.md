# Design a readable data table

## Inputs

- [DATA] (required): The data for the table (pasted rows or a description of columns and values), with units.
- [PURPOSE] (optional): Where the table appears (slide, written report, appendix, dashboard), who reads it, and what they should find or compare.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
You are an information designer who treats tables as seriously as charts. A table is the right choice when readers need to look up exact values or compare a few numbers precisely. Good tables follow a few well-established rules: numbers right-aligned with consistent decimals, units in headers rather than every cell, rows ordered by meaning, minimal lines, white space instead of grid boxes, and one deliberate highlight that tells the reader where to look.
</context>

<task>
Design a table for this data and purpose.

<data>
[DATA]
</data>

<purpose>
[PURPOSE]
</purpose>

1. State the reader's job: what they should look up or compare, and the one thing they should notice first. If the purpose is missing, infer it from the data and say so. If a chart would serve the purpose better (a trend over many periods, a distribution), say so in one line and still design the table.
2. Choose the content: which columns and rows earn a place, which to drop or move to an appendix, and whether to add derived columns (change, share of total, versus target) that answer the reader's question directly. Aim for no more than about seven columns on a slide.
3. Order columns by importance from left to right with the identifier first, and order rows by something meaningful (size, rank, a natural sequence such as time or a hierarchy), not alphabetically unless readers look items up by name. Put totals at the bottom (or top for summaries) and set them apart.
4. Format numbers: consistent precision per column (the fewest decimals that keep the meaning), thousands separators, units and scale in the header (for example "Revenue (€ thousands)"), negative numbers with a minus sign, percentages versus percentage-point changes labelled correctly, and missing values shown consistently (for example an en dash, explained in a footnote).
5. Set alignment: text left, numbers right, headers aligned with their column contents.
6. Style: no vertical lines, light horizontal rules only to separate header and totals, subtle banding only for long tables, and one highlight (bold, a soft background, or a single accent colour) on the cells the reader should notice, never colour alone.
7. Write the title as a statement of the takeaway where the medium allows it, and footnotes for definitions, sources, date of data and abbreviations.
8. Render the table in Markdown with the values formatted as designed, and describe styling that Markdown cannot show.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not change any value except by rounding, and keep rounding consistent. If rounded parts do not add to the rounded total, add a footnote rather than adjusting a number.
- Flag inconsistencies you notice in the data (totals that do not match, mixed units) instead of silently fixing them.
- Keep labels short and plain; spell out abbreviations in a footnote.
</constraints>

<output_format>
## Purpose
Reader's job and the first thing they should notice.

## Design decisions
Bullets: content, order, formats, alignment, highlight, each with a short reason.

## Table
The title, then the Markdown table, then styling notes.

## Footnotes
## Variant
One line on how the table would change for the other medium (slide versus report).
</output_format>
