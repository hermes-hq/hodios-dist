# Prepare for an open-book exam

## Inputs

- [COURSE] (required): The course and exam, for example "Second-year Contract Law", "Intro Statistics final".
- [MATERIALS] (required): The materials allowed or available (textbook, lecture notes, statutes, formula book, own notes), with page counts or a table of contents if possible.
- [EXAM_FORMAT] (optional): Optional format details such as duration, number and type of questions, marks, whether it is timed in a room or take-home over hours or days, printed or digital materials, and any collaboration or AI rules.

Take each value from the invocation or the user’s message. If a required value is missing, ask for it once.

<context>
Students often do worse in open-book exams than in closed-book ones because they prepare less and spend the exam searching. Open-book questions are written to test application and analysis, so there is no time to learn the material during the exam; the materials are there to check exact details, not to understand topics for the first time. Strong candidates know the content, have built a fast way to find things (tabs, an index, summary sheets), and follow a rule about when a lookup is worth the time. Take-home exams add a different risk: time sprawls, and collaboration or AI rules are strict.

<task>
Build an open-book exam strategy for [COURSE].

1. State what is allowed and the assumptions you are making. If it is unclear whether materials may be annotated, tabbed, printed or digital, or whether the exam is timed in a room or take-home, list the questions to check with the course team. If the materials or format say the exam is closed book, say so and recommend a closed-book approach instead.
2. Design the index system:
   - A tab scheme for the main material: one colour per topic or question type, tabs at section starts and at the pages used most (key tables, formulas, definitions, leading cases).
   - A one-page master index, alphabetical by term, case, formula or concept, each pointing to a page or summary sheet. Explain how to build it while revising, not the night before.
3. Plan summary sheets, one per major topic: what goes on each (definitions in the student's own words, formulas with when to use them, step-by-step methods, key cases or examples with one-line principles, common traps), and how long each should be.
4. Make a time plan: a minutes-per-mark budget, reading and planning time, a cap on lookup time per question (for example two minutes, then answer from memory and mark it to check later), and time at the end for checking. For take-home exams, a block-by-block schedule across the available hours with breaks, a drafting and checking phase, and a stop time before the deadline.
5. Set lookup rules: look up exact values, precise wording, citations and formulas you know exist; do not look up to learn a topic; answer from understanding first and verify after.
6. Plan a practice run: a past or practice paper under the real conditions using the index and sheets, timing every lookup, then fixing the index where lookups were slow.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not assume what is permitted. Anything not stated is an assumption to check, and the plan must work if the stricter answer turns out to be true.
- For take-home exams, state the integrity points to check: whether collaboration, online sources or AI tools are allowed, and how sources must be cited.
- If the materials or format say when the exam is, fit the index, summary sheets and practice run into the days left and say what to cut if time is short; otherwise give a rough number of hours each part takes to build so the student can schedule it.
- Do not write exam answers or summary sheet content beyond short illustrative examples.
</constraints>

<output_format>
## What is allowed
Stated rules, assumptions, and questions to check.
## Index
The tab scheme as a table: Colour | Topic | Where the tabs go. Then how to build the master index.
## Summary sheets
A table: Sheet | Contents | Length.
## Time plan
A table of the exam timeline with minutes per section and lookup caps.
## Lookup rules
4 to 6 short rules to memorise.
## Practice run
Steps and what to adjust afterwards.
